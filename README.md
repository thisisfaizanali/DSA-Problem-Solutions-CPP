# DSA Problem Solutions - C++

Welcome to my repository! This is a comprehensive collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms** solutions in C++, featuring problems from **Striver's SDE Sheet** and **Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet**.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository started with a simple goal: complete Striver's SDE Sheet. But as any DSA enthusiast knows, one problem leads to another, one concept branches into ten more, and before you know it, you're deep in the rabbit hole.

What began with the SDE Sheet naturally expanded into the A2Z DSA Sheet - especially when I hit Binary Search and realized I needed to really _understand_ it, not just solve it. The same happened with Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming. Each topic demanded deeper exploration, more problems, more patterns.

So here we are: a comprehensive collection of DSA solutions that maps my entire learning journey. From basic array manipulations to complex graph algorithms, from simple recursion to intricate DP patterns : it's all here.

Whether you're preparing for interviews, competing in contests, or just love the art of problem-solving, I hope this collection serves you as well as creating it has served me.
